# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis was to get a summary of ride-sharing data based on different city types (rural, suburban, and urban) and dispaly a multiple-line chart of total fares based on those different city types.

## PyBer Analysis Summary
The results of the analysis showed that urban cities had the highest fares while rural cities had the lowest fares. There are three recommendations to addressing the disparities in fares based on city type.
- **1** If we want to drive the average fare per driver up in urban areas, charge riders more per ride.
- **2** If we want to decrease the number of drivers in urban areas, incentivize drivers to do more rides in rural and suburban areas.
- **3** If we want to increase the amount of rides in rural areas, add more drivers to decrease wait time.
